resending against rhel6/master as the older one that didn't apply
clean is getting acked. I also replaced the forced define with an
#error if not defined to verify our buildsystem gets it right at all
times. Upstream won't have the #error and later we can go just with
the upstream version once we're sure the glibc in buildsystem gets
this right for quite some time.

previous patch applied by hand is in this build
